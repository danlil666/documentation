I was traveling and busy last week and my creativity is drained. But let's get meshy and enjoy the extremely grumpy processing of meshes in Rhino.

I downloaded this [Moai statue from Thingiverse made by Julien_DaCosta](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2493386).

I was thinking that maybe I can make a plant pot by carving a hole out of the mouth so that it will look like the mouth is spitting out a plant.

## Plan for the lamp!

I was fascinated by the idea that one can put a lightbulb into their mouth but will never be able to retract it. The myth says it is due to vacuum pressure or jaw bone anatomy. I'm not interested in trying out but I can not get the idea of biting a lightbulb out of my head. So I'm going to make Moia do it!

I figured that might be tricking the whole 'assemble your design around the innereds' requirement, so I will make some adjustment later so that the mouth screws into the innereds.

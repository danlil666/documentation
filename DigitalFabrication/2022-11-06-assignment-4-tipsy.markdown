I was traveling and busy during the last 10 days and my creativity is drained. Still, I want my project to revolve around tetrahedron.

I'm making a container in the shape of a tetrahedron. It's harder than I thought since the edges are not perpendicular to each other. I created edges that will bite into each other using boolean difference and boolean union.

I 3D-printed three sides and shrank them by 99.5% to accommodate tolerance.

It's not a perfect bite, and it won't stand on its tip, hence the name 'tipsy'.

Hi! I am Danli.

I am a first-year PhD in HCDE, University of Washington.

I work at the intersection of materials intelligence and natures capacity.

You can find my research work [here](https://danli-luo.com/):

I'm learning how to use [jekyll][jekyll-organization], which this website is built upon.

[jekyll-organization]: https://github.com/jekyll

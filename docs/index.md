Hi! This is Danli.

This website is intended to showcase my progress in Prof. Nadya's class, a special topic about digital fabrication in HCDE.

I look forward to all the fun and creative discussions about to happen in this class.

As a starter, I'm learning how to use [Github](https://github.com/danlil666) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I hope by the end of this course I will be able to not only make things but also create things.

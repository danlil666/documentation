I built a lamp last week, and I'm going to cast the base of that lamp.

I again used this [tiki head from Thingiverse made by Julien_DaCosta](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2493386). 

## making mold

Making the mold is easy. I created a box that is just slightly larger than the shoulder of the tiki head, which is the orange part I printed last week. I pour oomoo around the 3D printed model inside of the box and now I have a mold for the shoulder. I suspended the model with two tongue depressors because they were what I could find nearby.

But I realized that we are supposed to make a two-part mold and learn about registration keys. So I repurposed the [assignment two weeks ago](https://danlil666.github.io/docs/HCDE533/2022-11-07-assignment-5-tiki/) and made a tiki head with a bulb in its mouth.

The 3D printer has been giving me troubles. After troubleshooting with Junchao, we figured that it might be because the tiki head was a mesh and the mold of a mold is a polysurface. Combining them together was a lot of hassle. But anyway, I managed to print two half-molds on two printers and I have to conclude that Prusa i3 is slightly more superior than Ender pro 3.

I just poured mixed oomoo into the two half-molds and got my silicone mold.

## casting

Time for some casting! 

I casted the lamp base first. I certainly looks good!

I did not use hydrostone and instead used Rockite. It's a fast-setting cement. I thought that texture would go very well with tiki head! And it does!

So I casted 4 in total.

The parting line has been a headache. Once I demold after 15 minutes, I would scrape off the extra materials on the parting line. This helped a little!
